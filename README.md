# Surfs_Up

## Overview 
Everyone loves to enjoy their vacations and would love to have the best time. The purpose of this analysis was to find out the temperature trend for a certain location so that we can open a surf shop. We had to look through temperature throughout the year and find out what the temperature is year-round. Looking at the temperature for June and December specifically so that we can see if the shop can sustain throughout the year. 

## Results
The results of this analysis between the two months were interesting. Looking at the two moths there are some key differences. 
* 1 of the differences are obviously the max temperatures. The temp in June was higher than the temp in December. June should be a great time of the year for surfing and ice cream so we can be sure there is going to be a lot of people in this location.

* The 2nd difference is the average temperature. Although in June it should be extremely warm looking at the two temperature averages, they are a bit close with June at 74 and December at 71.

* Another difference is the count between the two. There are more dates for June than there are for December meaning there are more observations of temperatures for that month. 
Although there are some differences this still shows that this location is a great place to open the surf shop. With nice weather I’m sure a lot of people will appreciate having this shop here. 

## Summary
Looking at the data it will be great to put the surf shop here. Although looking at the temperature is great, but we need to see the precipitation as well. Querying the precipitation can show us that there is low precipitation in this area, so with low rain possibility this can be great for surfing all day. another query that can be done could be on the population. What if we put the surf shop and there is a low amount of traffic of people, although the temperature and weather is great but if no one is showing up in this location it wouldn’t be great. All in this should be a great place to put the shop and it will be great to participate in.
